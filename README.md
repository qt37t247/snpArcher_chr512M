snpArcher is a reproducible workflow optimized for nonmodel organisms and comparisons across datasets, built on the [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#) workflow management system. It provides a streamlined approach to dataset acquisition, variant calling, quality control, and downstream analysis.

### Usage
For usage instructions and complete documentation, please visit our [docs](https://snparcher.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### Datasets generated by snpArcher
A number of resequencing datasets have been run with snpArcher generating consistent variant calls, available via [Globus](https://www.globus.org/) in the [Comparative Population Genomics Data collection](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=a6580c44-09fd-11ee-be16-195c41bc0be4&origin_path=%2F). Details of data processing are described [in our manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.22.546168v1). If you use any of these datasets in your projects, please cite both the [snpArcher paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.22.546168v1) and the original data producers.
